### --- Day 17: Trick Shot ---

You finally decode the Elves' message. <code>HI</code>, the message says. You continue searching for
the sleigh keys.

Ahead of you is what appears to be a large [ocean
trench](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oceanic_trench). Could the keys have fallen into it? You'd
better send a probe to investigate.

The probe launcher on your submarine can fire the probe with any
[integer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer) velocity in the <code>x</code> (forward) and
<code>y</code> (upward, or downward if negative) directions. For example, an initial
<code>x,y</code> velocity like <code>0,10</code> would fire the probe straight up, while an initial
velocity like <code>10,-1</code> would fire the probe forward at a slight downward angle.

The probe's <code>x,y</code> position starts at <code>0,0</code>. Then, it will follow some
trajectory by moving in <b>steps</b>. On each step, these changes occur in the following order:

- The probe's <code>x</code> position increases by its <code>x</code> velocity.
- The probe's <code>y</code> position increases by its <code>y</code> velocity.
- Due to drag, the probe's <code>x</code> velocity changes by <code>1</code> toward the value
  <code>0</code>; that is, it decreases by <code>1</code> if it is greater than <code>0</code>,
  increases by <code>1</code> if it is less than <code>0</code>, or does not change if it is already
  <code>0</code>.
- Due to gravity, the probe's <code>y</code> velocity decreases by <code>1</code>.

For the probe to successfully make it into the trench, the probe must be on some trajectory that
causes it to be within a <b>target area</b> after any step. The submarine computer has already
calculated this target area (your puzzle input). For example:

<pre>
target area: x=20..30, y=-10..-5</pre>

This target area means that you need to find initial <code>x,y</code> velocity values such that
after any step, the probe's <code>x</code> position is at least <code>20</code> and at most
<code>30</code>, <b>and</b> the probe's <code>y</code> position is at least <code>-10</code> and at
most <code>-5</code>.

Given this target area, one initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area
after any step is <code>7,2</code>:

<pre>
.............#....#............
.......#..............#........
...............................
S........................#.....
...............................
...............................
...........................#...
...............................
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTT#TT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
</pre>

In this diagram, <code>S</code> is the probe's initial position, <code>0,0</code>. The
<code>x</code> coordinate increases to the right, and the <code>y</code> coordinate increases
upward. In the bottom right, positions that are within the target area are shown as <code>T</code>.
After each step (until the target area is reached), the position of the probe is marked with
<code>#</code>. (The bottom-right <code>#</code> is both a position the probe reaches and a position
in the target area.)

Another initial velocity that causes the probe to be within the target area after any step is
<code>6,3</code>:

<pre>
...............#..#............
...........#........#..........
...............................
......#..............#.........

.....................#.........
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................T#TTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
</pre>

Another one is <code>9,0</code>:

<pre>
S........#.....................
.................#.............
...............................
........................#......
...............................
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTT#
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
....................TTTTTTTTTTT
</pre>

One initial velocity that <b>doesn't</b> cause the probe to be within the target area after any step
is <code>17,-4</code>:

<pre>
S..............................................................
...............................................................
...............................................................
...............................................................
.................#.............................................
....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................
....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................
....................TTTTTTTTTTT................................

</pre>

The probe appears to pass through the target area, but is never within it after any step. Instead,
it continues down and to the right - only the first few steps are shown.

If you're going to fire a highly scientific probe out of a super cool probe launcher, you might as
well do it with <b>style</b>. How high can you make the probe go while still reaching the target
area?

In the above example, using an initial velocity of <code>6,9</code> is the best you can do, causing
the probe to reach a maximum <code>y</code> position of <code><b>45</b></code>. (Any higher initial
<code>y</code> velocity causes the probe to overshoot the target area entirely.)

Find the initial velocity that causes the probe to reach the highest <code>y</code> position and
still eventually be within the target area after any step. <b>What is the highest <code>y</code>
position it reaches on this trajectory?</b>
